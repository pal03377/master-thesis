= Introduction
What is the best way to provide feedback on online exercises?
Written feedback can have many forms, including simple corrections, marks, comments, questions and targets~@morris2021formative.
Feedback is information provided by an agent, such as a teacher, to a learner, such as a student, regarding aspects of the learner's performance or understanding~@hattie2007feedback. It can effectively guide students toward the correct solution and help them learn from their mistakes, depending on the quality and impact of the feedback~@hattie2007feedback.
Feedback is an essential part of the learning process, and it is especially important in the context of online learning. In this context, feedback can be provided by a teacher or a computer system. The latter is called automatic feedback.
Automatic feedback can be especially helpful in courses with a large number of students, where it is not feasible for a teacher to provide feedback to each student individually~@ArTEMiS.
Keuning et al. found that such feedback has increased in diversity over the last decades and "new techniques are being applied to generate feedback that is increasingly helpful for students"~@keuning2018review.

The automated generation of feedback is a challenging task, yet it is crucial for the success of online learning: It is difficult for teachers to provide feedback to each student individually in courses with a large number of students~@ArTEMiS. The number of students in computer science courses at universities is steadily increasing. At the Technical University of Munich, the number of full-time students#footnote[i.e., full-time equivalents] has recently increased by more than 2,400 within five years#footnote[TUM in Zahlen 2020, https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1638190/1638190.pdf].

The current state of the art does not yet provide a satisfactory solution to fully automating the feedback process for most types of exercises. However, the process of providing individual feedback to each student can be supported by semi-automatic feedback systems, e.g. the CoFee framework for textual exercises presented by Bernius et al~@cofee.
The implementation of the CoFee framework is called _Athena_#footnote[Source code and setup documentation available on https://github.com/ls1intum/Athena-CoFee, last visited August 17th, 2023] and is integrated into the _Artemis_ learning platform#footnote[Source code and links to the documentation available on https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis, last visited August 14th, 2023] that is developed and used at the Technical University of Munich. From 2019 to 2021, this integration effectively streamlined the grading process for 34 exercises~@cofee2.

Cremer and Michel recently enhanced the system in two key dimensions: adding support for more languages in text assessments and increasing the system's capacity to handle a higher workload~#cite("atheneLanguage", "atheneLoadBalancer").

== Problem <problem>
// Note: Describe the problem that you like to address in your thesis to show the importance of your work. Focus on the negative symptoms of the currently available solution.
Although Athena effectively generates feedback suggestions for tutors in text submissions using the CoFee approach~@cofee2, a significant issue remains: The current architecture of Athena constrains its extensibility and adaptability.

Currently, Athena is bound to one approach in the process of generating feedback suggestions for tutors and it only supports text submissions using the _CoFee_ approach. This decreases the flexibility and extensibility of the system and is one of the main points we will improve in this thesis.
On a more practical level, Athena does not support programming exercises, which are commonly featured in computer science courses. The lack of support for programming exercises in Athena is a limitation, especially considering that this feature is a main advantage of Artemis over other exercise management systems, such as Moodle#footnote[https://moodle.org]. Therefore, extending Athena to support programming exercises is a critical area for improvement.
// Support for automatic assessments of modeling exercises in Athena would also be beneficial. These are already possible using _Compass_~@compass, which is currently integrated with Artemis and is not a focus of this thesis.

Two types of actors could have problems with the current status of Athena:
- *Tutors* in courses with manually graded programming exercises: They cannot profit from Athena's assessment generation capabilities, because Athena does not support programming exercises. This means that they won't get any automatically generated suggestions for programming exercises, which would save them a lot of time.
  For textual exercises, Athena currently provides suggestions for around 45\% of the submissions~@cofee2.
- Also, it is difficult for *researchers* to integrate additional approaches and features into Athena, as the system is currently bound to one approach for each step in the generation process. 
  The system for the actual choice of assessment suggestions is part of Artemis (outside Athena). This external dependency makes it impossible to change the logic for the suggestion choice independently of Artemis. In a more general sense, this architecture violates the _Single Responsibility Principle_. // TODO: Add citation for SRP
  More practically, it prevents Athena from being used with other LMSs than Artemis, which is a significant limitation.
  For example, recent innovations in the field of machine learning like the openly available LLaMA language model~@touvron2023llama or the GPT-4 model from OpenAI~@openai2023gpt4 could be used to improve the quality of feedback suggestions, but this is not possible with the current system architecture.

== Motivation
// Note: Motivate scientifically why solving this problem is necessary. What kind of benefits do we have by solving the problem?
In this section, we explore the potential benefits of addressing the identified issues in Athena, specifically its constrained approach to generating feedback suggestions and its current inability to support programming exercises.

Quality feedback to students holds significant importance. To this end, equipping tutors with the necessary support to improve their feedback delivery is crucial. This support allows tutors to allocate more time to challenging assessments. Evaluations by tutors, both positive and negative, not only document students' knowledge but also play a pivotal role in shaping their learning and motivation~@wulf2010feedback. As such, these assessments must be conducted with care and effectiveness~@sabilah2018openended.

Second, extending Athena to support programming exercises aligns with Artemis's strengths and addresses a significant gap in its current functionality. By enabling Athena to generate feedback suggestions for programming exercises, we align the capabilities of Athena with the fundamental features of Artemis, thereby creating a more seamless and comprehensive user experience for tutors.
By extension, the experience for students will improve as well, as they will receive more timely, consistent and thorough feedback on their submissions.
Hattie et al. note that only feedback that addresses multiple dimensions (like the direction, the progress and the next steps) is effective in improving student performance~@hattie2007educational, so tutors must have the time and resources to provide such feedback. Athena can help with this by providing feedback suggestions, which will save tutors time and effort.

Last, keeping the Athena system updated with the latest developments in the field of machine learning is essential for maintaining its competitive edge. The current system architecture has limitations when it comes to integrating new approaches into Athena. With a redesigned system, we aim to significantly enhance its flexibility and extensibility. This update will allow Athena to more easily incorporate future innovations in feedback suggestions, and to adapt swiftly to the state of the art. Additionally, this new architecture will facilitate the combination of different approaches, accelerating research and enabling more timely alignment with emerging developments.

== Objectives
// Note: Describe the research goals and/or research questions and how you address them by summarizing what you want to achieve in your thesis, e.g. developing a system and then evaluating it.
This thesis aims to address the issues outlined in @problem by advocating for a transformative architectural shift in Athena, designed to enhance its flexibility and extensibility.
To achieve this overarching objective, we have identified the following specific sub-goals:

=== Shift in System Responsibilities
We want to shift the responsibility of computing feedback suggestions from the Artemis system to Athena. This will allow us to decouple the two systems and make Athena more flexible and extensible.
The Athena system will be independently deployable and will be able to provide feedback suggestions for any learning management system (LMS) like Artemis. Further development will also be accelerated, as Athena can be developed and tested independently of Artemis.

=== Modularized Architecture
The transformation to a modularized architecture will be realized by evolving the current system architecture to accommodate various _assessment modules_.
There will be an _assessment module manager_ that is responsible for managing the interactions between the assessment modules and the LMS.
An assessment module is a self-contained component designed to offer various functionalities related to feedback suggestion generation. At its core, it provides a mechanism to generate feedback suggestions for a submission.
Additionally, based on specific requirements, the module may offer extended capabilities, such as receiving feedback from tutors or suggesting a subsequent submission for a student.

=== Assisting Tools for Module Development
We will provide a basic tool for testing assessment modules while in development, called the "playground". This will serve as a straightforward web interface, allowing developers to send sample submissions and feedback to the assessment module under development, request feedback suggestions, and comprehensively test the module using exemplary data.

Additionally, we will offer a Python package, called `athena`, aimed at streamlining the creation of assessment modules. While the technical stack for developing an assessment module remains unrestricted, this supplementary tool is designed to enhance the development experience and accelerate the development process for Python developers.

=== Programming Assessment Module "ThemisML"
We will develop a specialized assessment module for programming exercises, informed by insights from the practical course _iPraktikum_ at the Technical University of Munich.
This module will leverage the pre-trained model CodeBERT~@codeBERT, developed by Microsoft, to embed and cluster programming submissions. This approach will enable the generation of feedback suggestions for programming exercises like CoFee.
Furthermore, we will seamlessly integrate these suggestions into the assessment user interface of Artemis.

= Background
// Note: Describe each proven technology/concept shortly that is important to understand your thesis. Point out why it is interesting for your thesis. Make sure to incorporate references to important literature here.
In this chapter, the key concepts and technologies essential to this thesis are presented. First, the Artemis learning management system is introduced, which serves as the integration point for Athena.
Next, the CoFee framework is discussed; this is the current method employed by Athena to generate feedback suggestions for textual exercises.
This is followed by an overview of the ThemisML approach, the proposed strategy for Athena to generate feedback suggestions for programming exercises.
Finally, we give an overview of the microservice architecture, which Athena leverages to structure its components.

== Artemis
Artemis is an open-source automated assessment management system designed for large computer science classes~@ArTEMiS. It automatically evaluates students' programming assignments and provides immediate, iterative feedback, enabling students to refine their solutions~@ArTEMiS.
It features an online code editor and interactive exercise instructions, making it adaptable and programming language-independent. The system is intended to reduce instructors' manual assessment workload and to enhance the learning experience for students by offering timely and actionable feedback on their work~@ArTEMiS.
At the time of writing, Artemis supports exercises in the following formats: programming, text, modeling, file upload and quiz.

== CoFee
// Will describe in "Current System"
CoFee is "a machine learning approach designed to suggest computer-aided feedback in open-ended textual exercises"~@cofee.
We will describe the CoFee approach and its current implementation in more detail in @currentSystem.

== ThemisML
ThemisML is a "system for automated feedback suggestions of programming exercises"#footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Themis-ML, last visited September 5th, 2023] developed by a group of the practical course "iPraktikum" in the winter semester of 2022/23 at the Technical University of Munich. It is based on the CodeBERT model~@codeBERT, which is a pre-trained model for programming language processing by Microsoft.
Its source code is openly available on #link("https://github.com/ls1intum/Themis-ML")[GitHub]. The following description is based on the documentation of the system, available at https://ls1intum.github.io/Themis.

Similar to CoFee, ThemisML analyzes student code submissions and compares them with past feedback from previous assessments. Based on this analysis, ThemisML proposes context-specific feedback for the current submission, which tutors can review and modify as needed. This system aims to streamline the assessment process, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of feedback provided to students.
ThemisML employs ANTLR4#footnote[https://www.antlr.org, last visited August 17th, 2023] for method extraction from code and utilizes CodeBERTScore~@zhou2023codebertscore#footnote[Source code available at https://github.com/neulab/code-bert-score, last visited August 17th, 2023. At the time of initial development, the source code was already available, but the complementary paper was not released yet.], a wrapper for the CodeBERT machine learning model~@codeBERT, to compare code submissions and assess their similarity.
Thus, ThemisML is a tool that helps tutors who use the Themis app give clearer and more focused feedback on student programming assignments.

// == FastAPI // TODO: Do I want this here?

== Microservice Architecture
// TODO: Also talk about Docker?
Microservices are small, autonomous services that communicate through well-defined APIs, allowing them to be independently deployed and evolved without tight coupling to other services~@newman2015building.

Newman highlights several notable advantages of adopting a microservice architecture in the book "Building Microservices"~@newman2015building, including:
- *Technology Heterogeneity:* This architecture allows for the use of diverse technologies across different services, offering flexibility and potentially enhancing the development process.
- *Resilience:* The isolated nature of microservices ensures that the failure of one service does not directly impact the functionality of others, contributing to the overall system's robustness.
- *Scaling:* Microservices facilitate more straightforward and efficient scaling of individual services, as opposed to the often cumbersome scaling of a monolithic application.

While these advantages are enticing, microservices are also generally seen as more complex to manage and deploy compared to monolithic architectures~@hossain2023microservice,
they can be more difficult to test in combination with other services~@hossain2023microservice,
and can even be worse in performance in specific cases~@aldebagy2018comparative.

= Related Work
// Note: Describe related work regarding your topic and emphasize your (scientific) contribution in contrast to existing approaches/concepts/workflows. Related work is usually current research by others and you defend yourself against the statement: âWhy is your thesis relevant? The problem was already solved by XYZ.â If you have multiple related works, use subsections to separate them.

_Atenea_#footnote[Not to be confused with *Athena*, the name of the system we are developing.] is a system that provides automatic scores for short textual answers in English and Spanish computer science exercises using Latent Semantic Analysis and other natural language processing techniques~@atenea2005.
It scores submissions based on the similarity of the student's answer to a set of reference answers provided by the teacher. This approach has the problem of requiring the teacher to provide a set of reference answers for each exercise, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Also, the range of possible answers is limited to the ones provided by the teacher and answers similar to them. This means that the system is not able to recognize answers that are correct but different from the given ones.
Atenea, like Athena, is a modularized system to allow for the integration of different scoring methods, but this remains within the scope of different ways to grade free-text answers.

#linebreak()
Alikaniotis et al. propose a system for Automated Text Scoring that uses a deep learning approach to score the quality of a text~@alikaniotis2016. The system makes its results more interpretable by providing the locations of the text that are most relevant to the score. This is done by using Long-Short Term Memory networks trained on the Kaggle dataset containing almost 13,000 essays, marked by two raters.
The system is different from Athena in that it is not focused on providing feedback to the student but on scoring the quality of the text. It also only generally works on essays, while Athena is designed to work on a broader range of exercises.

#linebreak()
Bernius et al. introduce _CoFee_, a machine-learning methodology developed to provide computer-assisted feedback for open-ended textual assignments~@cofee. While CoFee addresses a specific subset of our broader objective, our goal is to support different types of exercises, including text-based ones. We integrated CoFee into Athena as an assessment module for text exercises. The name "Athena"#footnote[Also sometimes referred to as "Athene"] was previously used for the integrated system, but we will use it to refer to the new system in this work.
CoFee is integrated into Athena as an assessment module for text exercises. Alongside it, there are other assessment modules, some of which support programming exercises.

// TODO: This seems a bit out of place...
#linebreak()
Chow et al. integrated an automatic programming feedback system into the _Grok Learning platform_ to provide direct feedback to students~@chow2017automated.
They utilize different methods to create hints for students, including clustering, pattern mining and filtering. These hints include potential failing inputs, suggested code changes and concept explanations. The system exclusively works for exercises in the programming language Python.
It is different from Athena in that it is not focused on providing feedback suggestions to tutors but on providing hints to students while they solve the exercise. Also, Athena is not limited to Python but can be used for programming exercises using any programming language, as well as text exercises.

#linebreak()
Sing et al. propose an automated feedback generation for introductory programming assignments that uses a sample solution written in a subset of Python to give feedback in the form of a list of changes necessary to transform the student's submission into a solution with the same behavior~@singh2013automated. The system can detect common mistakes and provide feedback on them, but its feedback is limited to suggestions on how to fix the mistakes in the code. It does not provide any feedback on the quality of the code or the design of the solution. Neither does it provide any feedback on the student's approach to solving the problem or deeper insight into the underlying misunderstanding that led to the mistake.
Athena can provide feedback suggestions for programming exercises, but it is not limited to providing suggestions on how to fix mistakes in the code. Depending on the chosen assessment module, Athena can provide feedback on the quality of the code, the design of the solution, and the student's approach to solving the problem. Furthermore, the assessment modules in Athena generally do not require a sample solution to work.

// Note that generally, one could include related work that proves to be useful as an assessment module in Athena:
// TODO: Does this make sense here?
#linebreak()
Athena has been designed with adaptability in mind. In the future, findings from other research or methodologies can be incorporated into it if they are shown to be useful for providing feedback suggestions in our specific context.


= Requirements Analysis
// Note: This chapter follows the Requirements Analysis Document Template in @bruegge2004object. Important: Make sure that the whole chapter is independent of the chosen technology and development platform. The idea is that you illustrate concepts, taxonomies and relationships of the application domain independent of the solution domain! Cite @bruegge2004object several times in this chapter.

== Overview <requirementsAnalysisOverview>
// Note: Provide a short overview about the purpose, scope, objectives and success criteria of the system that you like to develop.
// TODO: Make it sound less like two people are working on the specific thesis topic, just on the whole system in general
Despite our intentions to plan and detail it meticulously, we anticipate that we will only be able to fulfill some specifications for the new semi-automatic grading system. With the limitation of only two people working on this project for only six months in mind, our strategy leans toward the progressive delivery of a scaled-down system. Prioritizing high-quality code and thorough documentation, we opt for this approach over rushing the development of an expansive yet potentially flawed prototype.

== Current System <currentSystem>
// Note: This section is only required if the proposed system (i.e. the system that you develop in the thesis) should replace an existing system.
// - current: System also called Athena / Athene (somewhat inconsistent), as a "reference implementation" of an approach to giving automatic feedback called CoFee (@cofee)
// current: Athena-CoFee integrated into existing LMS (Learning Management System) Artemis
// - Athena-CoFee system is essentially a service for segmentation and clustering test exercise submissions, for Artemis.
// - When the deadline of an exercise is reached, the following happens.
// * The *Artemis LMS* sends a list of submissions to the *Load Balancer* of Athena-CoFee, including a callback URL for later @atheneLoadBalancer
// * The *Load Balancer* distributes the next tasks between different services
// * The *Segmentation Service* partitions each submission into a list of `TextBlock`s, by start index and end index.
// * The *Embedding Service* uses deeply contextualized word representations (ElMO @elmo) for creating a linguistic embedding of the segments @cofee
// * The *Clustering Service* uses the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm to create clusters of the embedded segments.
// * The Load Balancer sends the segments and clusters to Artemis using the callback URL, where they are stored in the database
// - When a tutor starts assessing a student's submission, the Athena-CoFee subsystem within Artemis will suggest feedback on segments close to other ones in the same cluster based on feedback given on the other segments within the cluster.

// TODO: add more detail

The current system under investigation is named Athena but is occasionally referred to as Athene outside of this work. This system acts as a "reference implementation" for a distinctive approach to dispensing automatic feedback, known as CoFee (@cofee). We will call this system Athena-CoFee to avoid confusion with the newly proposed Athena system.
Athena-CoFee is integrated into the existing Learning Management System (LMS) Artemis, functioning as a service dedicated to segmenting and clustering test exercise submissions.

When a predetermined exercise deadline arrives, a sequence of events unfolds. Artemis LMS sends a list of submissions to the Load Balancer within Athena-CoFee, including a callback URL for subsequent use (@atheneLoadBalancer). This Load Balancer distributes the tasks among several different services.

The Segmentation Service first partitions each submission into a list of TextBlocks and stores their start and end indexes. The Embedding Service then adopts deeply contextualized word representations, specifically the ElMO model (@elmo), to construct a linguistic embedding of these segments (@cofee). Following this, the Clustering Service applies the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering (HDBSCAN, @hdbscan) algorithm to assemble clusters of the embedded segments.

Upon completion of these processes, the Load Balancer transmits the segmented and clustered data back to Artemis via the initially supplied callback URL, and this data is then stored in the database of the system.

Artemis activates the Athena-CoFee subsystem when a tutor begins to assess a student's submission. This subsystem suggests feedback for segments closely associated with others in the same cluster, drawing on feedback given on other segments within the cluster. This mechanism supports the tutor in providing a consistent and thorough evaluation of student submissions.

== Proposed System
// Note: Describe the proposed system in detail. Use the following subsections to structure your description.
We propose a new system on top of Athena-CoFee called Athena. In the following, we will describe the functional and non-functional requirements of Athena using the Requirements Analysis Document Template in @bruegge2004object.

=== Functional Requirements
// Note: List and describe all functional requirements of your system. Also mention requirements that you were not able to realize. The short title should be in the form âverb objectiveâ
//   - FR1 Short Title: Short Description. 
//   - FR2 Short Title: Short Description. 
//   - FR3 Short Title: Short Description.
Functional requirements are independent of implementation details. They solely describe the interactions between the system and its environment @bruegge2004object. We use ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 to specify functional requirements in a structured way.

== System Models
In this part of the requirements analysis, we will present the system models for the Athena system. We start by describing the scenarios that we envision for the system. Then, we present the use case model, analysis object model, dynamic model, and user interface of the system, including detailed diagrams and descriptions.

=== Scenarios
// Visionary Scenario: scenario that would perfectly solve the problem, even if it might not be realizable. Use free text description
// Demo Scenario: scenario that you can implement and demonstrate until the end of your thesis
A scenario is "a concrete, focused, informal description of a single feature of the system from the viewpoint of a single actor" @bruegge2004object. The following sections describe two visionary scenarios and one demonstration scenario.
\ \ 

*Visionary Scenarios*

*Real-time Automatic Feedback*
// The student already receives feedback suggestions in real-time themselves and submits a fully correct submission at the end, having learned a lot more in the process with the shortest feedback cycle possible. The system automatically finds mistakes and points the student to where they could be wrong with helpful but not too revealing feedback. This way, there is no need for additional grading, and the tutors for the course can fully concentrate on supporting the students in other ways.
Julia, a persistent student in a Data Structures course, and Leo, a dedicated tutor for the same course, find themselves in a modern, technologically advanced learning environment. This time, the students have an innovative tool at their disposal that offers real-time feedback suggestions while they are working on their exercises.
In this context, Julia encounters a complex assignment on tree data structures. As she works her way through the exercise, she benefits from the feedback suggestions of the system. The tool cleverly points out possible mistakes without revealing the entire solution, nudging Julia towards the correct path.
This intelligent feedback system operates like a silent tutor, helping Julia correct minor errors and improve her understanding in real time. It guides her, prompting her to think more critically about her code, and encourages her to find and fix errors independently. By the time Julia finishes the assignment and submits it, her work is free of errors. The immediate feedback she received throughout her work allowed her to correct her mistakes as she made them.
Freed from the time-consuming task of grading assignments, Leo can now invest more of his time in addressing students' conceptual questions and mentoring them in their learning journey. He can now engage more deeply with students.
\ \ 
*Enhancing Automatic Test Feedback*
// - The automatic tests to check the correctness of programming exercises provide accurate feedback, but it is not always helpful to the student.
// - Therefore, the _Introduction to Informatics_ course runs some basic tests after the submission deadline, but otherwise the tutors of the course grade the submissions manually.
// - This takes a lot of time and it is difficult (for the tutors) to always spot the exact place in which the tests fail.
// - Because of this, the course now uses Athena to enhance the automatic test results such that they are processed and their wording is automatically enhanced to provide more detail on the exact root cause of the underlying issue.
// - This way, tutors can focus on grading other related issues and can be much quicker overall.
Sophie, a dedicated tutor for the Introduction to Informatics course, and Noah, a meticulous student enrolled in the course, navigate a new approach to grading programming exercises. The course originally relied on a combination of automated tests and manual grading by tutors. However, the tests, although accurate, often failed to provide the detailed feedback students like Noah needed.
To overcome this limitation, the course implemented the Athena system.
As Noah submits his code, the Athena system evaluates it. It pinpoints where and why a test might have failed, providing feedback that is both precise and insightful.
Sophie no longer has to search through every line of code to spot errors or understand the causes of test failures. This change gives her more time to focus on other relevant aspects of students' submissions.
\ \ 
*Demo Scenarios*

*Quicker Feedback Loop*
// - Edward is a tutor in the Software Engineering course
// - Fiona is a student in the Software Engineering course
// - Fiona is an eager student who always submits solutions for all weekly exercises in the course, but she often makes a lot of minor mistakes that many other students struggle with in a similar fashion
// - Accurate and timely feedback is very important for Fiona, as she will still have the concepts of the last exercise freshly in mind - the sooner she gets the feedback, the more she still remembers the intricate details of the exercise and the fewer misconceptions will manifest in her mind in the meantime
// - Edward, however, needs help keeping up the pace for grading, as there are many students, and he always has a lot of work this way. Usually, the results of the manual grading process take about two weeks to complete.
// - With the help of accurate and quick automatic feedback suggestions, Edward can speed up the grading significantly. The system automatically detects common errors and suggests feedback on them. It can also find more difficult-to-spot mistakes, saving Edward a lot of time trying to find the issue in the submission.
// - This way, Fiona also gets her results faster.
Edward is a teaching assistant in a Software Engineering course. One of the students in the course is Fiona. She is a hard-working individual who always turns in her weekly exercises on time.
Fiona, like her classmates, sometimes makes small errors in her work. The nature of learning something new is such that these mistakes can happen, and catching them early is vital for steady progress. Fiona needs to understand her errors while the exercises are still fresh in her mind.
Edward, on the other hand, has a big task on his hands. He needs to grade many assignments, and this would usually take up to two weeks. This delay is not ideal because students need their feedback sooner rather than later.
However, the automatic feedback suggestion capabilities of the learning platform are enabled: Edward can see suggestions as soon as Fiona and the other students submit their work. The tool not only highlights the mistakes that students often make but also points out the less obvious ones that can be hard to spot. This saves Edward a lot of time and allows him to focus on delivering timely feedback.
For Fiona, it means she gets her feedback much faster. She can learn from her mistakes, adjust her approach, and move on to the next exercise without delay.

=== Use Case Model
// Note: This subsection should contain a UML Use Case Diagram including roles and their use cases. You can use colors to indicate priorities. Think about splitting the diagram into multiple ones if you have more than 10 use cases. *Important:* Make sure to describe the most important use cases using the use case table template. Also describe the rationale of the use case model, i.e. why you modeled it like you show it in the diagram.
According to Bruegge and Dutoit, use cases describe "a function provided by the system that yields a visible result for an actor"~@bruegge2004object. In the discussion, the actors will be represented by a _tutor_, an _administrator_ and _Athena_ interacting with the system Artemis, as well as a _researcher_ interacting with the system Athena.
We will break down the use case model into two separate diagrams for clarity.

#figure(
  image("figures/use-case-artemis.svg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Use Case Diagram for the Artemis system],
) <useCaseModelArtemis>

In @useCaseModelArtemis we show the use cases of a tutor, an administrator, and Athena in the Artemis system.

The administrator can _select the assessment module_ that is best suited for giving feedback suggestions for each specific type of exercise (#frlink(<frSelectAssessmentModule>)). Examples of the assessment module include the CoFee module for text exercises, ThemisML for programming exercises or one of the two available modules using LLMs for feedback suggestions on both programming and text exercises.
After the administrator has selected an assessment module and after the exercise due date is reached, the tutor can start assessing the submissions. They can _view a given submission_ that is chosen by the current assessment module in Athena. Then, they will directly receive feedback suggestions from Athena (#frlink(<frSuggestNextSubmission>)) and _review_ it in the user interface (#frlink(<frViewFeedbackSuggestionsUI>)).

The tutor can either _accept the suggestions_ or _modify them_ to match their evaluation of the submission (#frlink(<frAcceptFeedbackSuggestions>)). Alternatively, they can also choose to _discard any suggestion_ and to only give manual feedback (#frlink(<frDiscardFeedbackSuggestions>)). Any combination of accepting, modifying and discarding suggestions is possible. If the tutor accidentally discards a suggestion, they can _restore it_ (#frlink(<frRestoreDiscardedFeedbackSuggestions>)).
After the tutor has finished grading the submission, they can _submit_ the result to the system.

Athena uses that feedback to _learn from it_ (#frlink(<frLearnFromPastFeedback>)) and to improve its suggestions for future submissions.

#figure(
  image("figures/use-case-athena.svg", width: 60%),
  caption: [Use Case Diagram for the Athena System],
) <useCaseModelAthena>

// - The researcher can _inspect usage statistics_ about the acceptance rate of feedback suggestions and more. This enables them to evaluate the effectiveness of the system under evaluation.
// - The researcher can _test modules independently of the LMS_ to ensure that they work as intended without having to prepare a test exercise in the LMS and go through the process of setting up the exercise and submitting one or multiple submissions.
The use cases of a researcher within Athena are shown in @useCaseModelAthena.
Athena enables them to _inspect usage statistics_ related to the system's assessment modules to evaluate their effectiveness and how frequently the generated feedback is accepted or modified (#frlink(<frInspectUsageStatistics>))
Also, the researcher can _test the suggestion generation independently of the LMS_, which eliminates the need for test exercise configurations within Artemis. This approach facilitates more efficient verification of module functionality (#frlink(<frTestSuggestionGeneration>)).
Overall, these capabilities allow the researcher to significantly improve the effectiveness of the Athena system.

=== Analysis Object Model
// Note: This subsection should contain a UML Class Diagram showing the most important objects, attributes, methods and relations of your application domain including taxonomies using specification inheritance (see @bruegge2004object). Do not insert objects, attributes or methods of the solution domain. *Important:* Make sure to describe the analysis object model thoroughly in the text so that readers can understand the diagram. Also, write about the rationale about how and why you modeled the concepts like this.
As described by Bruegge and Dutoit, we use the analysis model to prepare for the architecture of the system~@bruegge2004object. The corresponding analysis object model is shown in @analysisObjectModel and includes the most important objects, attributes, methods and relations of the application domain.

#figure(
  image("figures/aom.svg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Analysis Object Model for the Artemis System concerning feedback suggestions],
) <analysisObjectModel>

A *Course* has multiple *Users*, each with a name. These might be *Students* or *Tutors*.
There are several *Exercises* in a course, which can either be *Text Exercises* or *Programming Exercises*, with the corresponding type of content. Each exercise has a title, a maximum score, and a due date.
Students can create a *Submission* for an exercise, which contains the actual content of their solution. Tutors can _view_ these submissions and _assess_ them.
A *SuggestionFactory* (Athena) provides *Feedback Suggestions* on the submission. The *Researcher* can change the _suggestion algorithms_ of the suggestion factory, _inspect the statistics_ of the assessment modules, and _test the generation of suggestions_ independently of the LMS. The *Administrator* can _inspect the health_ of the external generation service and _select the assessment module for each exercise type_.

The tutor can _accept_, _modify_ or _discard_ the suggestions generated by the suggestion factory.
There are two other types of feedback: *Manual Feedback*, which is given by the tutor, and *Automatic Feedback*, which is given on programming exercises using the fully automatic tests in Artemis.
A *Feedback* consists of the feedback text, an optional reference to the location in the submission that it applies to and a given number of credits, which can also be negative.
A collection of feedback creates an *Assessment*, which is the result of assessing a submission. It has a given non-negative score and can be _submitted_ by the tutor.

=== Dynamic Model
// Note: This subsection should contain dynamic UML diagrams. These can be a UML state diagrams, UML communication diagrams or UML activity diagrams. *Important:* Make sure to describe the diagram and its rationale in the text. *Do not use UML sequence diagrams.*
@activityDiagram shows an activity diagram of the assessment workflow with Athena.
When the submission due date of the exercise is reached, Artemis starts to prepare the exercise assessment. One step of this preparation is to send all submissions to Athena for processing.
Artemis then enables the assessment of the exercise for the tutors.
Depending on whether the feature is supported or not given the exercise, Artemis then either sends a list of submission IDs to Athena or chooses a random submission to assess. This way, Athena can select the best submission, i.e., the submission with the highest information gain, for the tutor to assess.
The selected submission is then sent to the tutor, who can request suggestions from Athena right after getting the submission. The tutor can also directly start the manual review in case Athena takes unusually long to respond to the request.
Athena then generates and sends the feedback suggestions to the tutor for review.
After the tutor has finished the assessment, they can submit the assessment to Artemis.
Artemis saves the assessment in its database and also sends the assessment to Athena for learning.
After this step, the assessment workflow is finished, and the tutor can start assessing the next submission until all submissions are assessed.

#figure(
  image("figures/activity-diagram.svg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Activity Diagram showing the assessment workflow with Athena],
) <activityDiagram>

=== User Interface <userInterface>
// Note: Show mockups of the user interface of the software you develop and their connections/transitions. You can also create a storyboard. *Important:* Describe the mockups and their rationale in the text.
In this section, we present the user interface mockups that illustrate how Athena integrates into Artemis, first for text exercises and then for programming exercises.

In Artemis, when a tutor starts a new assessment for a text or manually graded programming exercise, the system automatically selects a student's submission using Athena. The tutor receives the submission right away and can begin grading immediately. This design choice aims to prevent interruptions in the grading workflow that could arise from Athena's asynchronous generation of feedback suggestions. As the tutor evaluates the work, Athena-generated feedback suggestions become available in the user interface.

In the assessment interface seen in @userInterfaceTextFull, tutors can view student submissions and feedback suggestions on the left side. These suggestions resemble existing feedback but feature an additional badge labeled "Suggestion." By default, these are pre-accepted but can be discarded by the tutor. This design is consistent with the existing manual feedback system, as cited in @cofee.

We've made minor modifications to this design: the badge text has been changed from "Automatic" to "Suggestion" for clarity, and we've adopted a unique purple color for these badges, replacing the previous blue background.

#figure(
  image("figures/ui-mockups/text-full.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [The text assessment interface for tutors, showcasing a referenced feedback suggestion],
) <userInterfaceTextFull>

When a tutor opens the programming assessment interface, they are presented with a submission and available feedback suggestions. The interface is shown in @userInterfaceProgrammingFull. Feedback suggestions are displayed in a manner consistent with the text exercise interface, featuring a purple "Suggestion" badge for easy identification (see @userInterfaceProgrammingFull, A).

#figure(
  image("figures/ui-mockups/programming-full.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [The full programming assessment interface with an inline feedback suggestion],
) <userInterfaceProgrammingFull>

To differentiate these suggestions from already given manual feedback, they appear against a light purple background with semi-transparent text. This design choice serves as a visual cue, indicating that the suggestions are optional and require tutor approval for inclusion.
After accepting a suggestion, the background color shifts to align with the other, previously accepted feedback, and the text becomes opaque (see @userInterfaceProgrammingAccepted). The "Suggestion" badge remains visible to indicate that the feedback was generated by the Athena system.

#figure(
  image("figures/ui-mockups/programming-accepted.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [An accepted referenced inline feedback suggestion in the programming assessment interface],
) <userInterfaceProgrammingAccepted>

After discarding a feedback suggestion, it simply disappears to avoid further distraction.

Feedback that does not have a reference to a specific part of the text or programming submission is displayed in a separate section at the bottom of the interface. Its appearance is consistent with the inline feedback, as seen in @userInterfaceProgrammingUnreferenced.

#figure(
  image("figures/ui-mockups/programming-unreferenced.jpg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Unreferenced feedback suggestion at the bottom of the assessment interface. Left: before acceptance, right: after acceptance.],
) <userInterfaceProgrammingUnreferenced>

To simplify navigation within the assessment, files containing feedback suggestions are marked with a light bulb symbol in the file tree. A counter also displays the number of suggestions available for each file, offering tutors a quick reference (see @userInterfaceProgrammingFull, B).

Feedback suggestions are loaded once the assessment interface is opened. If there is a conflict between pre-existing tutor feedback and suggestions (e.g. because the assessment was saved before and is being continued now), the system prioritizes the tutor's feedback. This ensures that tutors can always see and build upon their feedback while grading.


= System Design <systemDesign>
// Note: This chapter follows the System Design Document Template in @bruegge2004object. You describe in this chapter how you map the concepts of the application domain to the solution domain. Some sections are optional if they do not apply to your problem. Cite @bruegge2004object several times in this chapter.
In the following sections, we present our system design, which is informed by the requirements and system models specified earlier. We start by identifying design goals based on our non-functional requirements and then move on to discuss our approach to subsystem decomposition, hardware-software mapping, data management strategies, and access control policies~@bruegge2004object.

== Overview

  width: 100%,
  radius: 10%,
  stroke: 0.5pt,
  fill: yellow,
)[
  Note: Provide a brief overview of the software architecture and references to other chapters (e.g. requirements analysis), references to existing systems, constraints impacting the software architecture.
]

== Design Goals <designGoals>
// Note: Derive design goals from your nonfunctional requirements, prioritize them (as they might conflict with each other) and describe the rationale of your prioritization. Any trade-offs between design goals (e.g., build vs. buy, memory space vs. response time), and the rationale behind the specific solution should be described in this section
We begin by establishing clear design goals for our proposed system, building on the nonfunctional requirements outlined in @nfr. Following this, we prioritize these goals and engage in a detailed discussion regarding the reasoning behind this ranking, as well as the possible trade-offs that may arise. To organize our approach, we use a set of design criteria suggested by Bruegge and Dutoit, systematically categorizing our design goals into five distinct and purposeful groups~@bruegge2004object.

// From the book (p. 243): 5 groups of design criteria:
// 1. Performance criteria: Response time, Throughput, Memory
// 2. Dependability criteria: Robustness, Reliability, Availability, Fault Tolerance, Security, Safety
// 3. Cost criteria: Development cost, Deployment cost, Upgrade cost, Maintenance cost, Administration cost
// 4. Maintenance criteria: Extensibility, Modifiability, Adaptability, Portability, Readability, Traceability of requirements
// 5. End user criteria: Utility, Usability

*Performance Criteria*
To ensure seamless integration within the Artemis grading workflow, the feedback suggestions of Athena must be provided swiftly, ideally within a few seconds, as specified in~#nfrlink(<nfrResponseTime>). Additionally, to prevent any delays in the grading process, tutors must be able to initiate grading immediately while the suggestions load asynchronously, as outlined in~#nfrlink(<nfrImmediateGrading>).

*Dependability Criteria*
For Athena to be a reliable component of Artemis's grading process, it must aim for a high level of system availability, targeting a 99.9% uptime, as suggested in~#nfrlink(<nfrSystemAvailability>). Additionally, it is vital to maintain the resilience of Athena by ensuring that a failure in one of its modules does not compromise the functionality of other modules, as defined in~#nfrlink(<nfrModuleIndependence>). In case of a failure in Athena, the LMS should remain largely unaffected, as specified in~#nfrlink(<nfrLMSIndependence>).

*Cost Criteria*
The security of Athena is very important, and strict measures are in place to ensure this. As per~#nfrlink(<nfrMutualAuthentication>), both Artemis and Athena authenticate each other using a shared API secret on all requests, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the data. Additionally, stringent data protection measures, in line with~#nfrlink(<nfrDataLeakagePrevention>), ensure that confidential student data is not leaked outside the Athena and Artemis systems.

*Maintenance Criteria*
Focusing on developer extensibility, Athena is architected to allow effortless integration of new modules and functionalities, fulfilling the goal of~#nfrlink(<nfrNewModuleDevelopment>). Complementing this, Athena is built to be easy to maintain and update, with comprehensive and clear documentation on system architecture and code as per~#nfrlink(<nfrUserDocumentation>).

To ensure that Athena is user-friendly and maintainable, extensive documentation is prepared. Detailed user documentation, as specified in ~#nfrlink(<nfrUserDocumentation>), will enable tutors and administrators to effectively utilize the system. For future development and maintenance needs, a comprehensive developer's guide is made available, detailing the system architecture, database schemas, and module development process, supporting~#nfrlink(<nfrUserDocumentation>).

*End User Criteria*
User experience is deeply considered in our design. Tutors using Artemis should be able to effortlessly view and interpret all feedback suggestions, aligning with~#nfrlink(<nfrFeedbackAccessibility>). Moreover, the system is developed to be easily configurable, aiming to encourage widespread adoption among educators and institutions, as highlighted in~#nfrlink(<nfrEasyConfiguration>).

*Prioritization and Trade-offs*
We prioritize the design goals from most important to least important as follows:
1. *End User Criteria*: 
   Ensuring a positive and efficient experience for the tutors using Artemis is the highest priority. This directly impacts the tutors' satisfaction and the effectiveness of the grading process. As Athena's feedback is central to the tutors' workflow within Artemis, ease of use is essential for successful integration and broad adoption.
2. *Maintenance Criteria*: 
   Maintenance, with a strong focus on extensibility, is critical to ensure that the wide and diverse range of developers contributing to the open-source Artemis project can easily understand, adapt, and extend Athena's implementation. Clear and thorough documentation is necessary, as it allows for more effortless collaboration and future enhancement.
3. *Performance Criteria*: 
   The system aims to be fast and responsive, with a strict requirement that submission selection should be within 2 seconds. Additionally, tutors must be able to grade submissions independently of whether feedback suggestions are available; grading should be unaffected if suggestions are delayed or unavailable. While performance remains crucial as it affects user satisfaction, some trade-offs in response times for feedback suggestions are acceptable to ensure that the grading process remains uninterrupted.
4. *Cost Criteria*: 
  Given that Artemis operates as an open-source project with limited funding, minimizing maintenance and administration costs is vital. We need to operate within a tight budget while striving to achieve effective integration and user satisfaction.
5. *Dependability Criteria*: 
   While high availability is valuable, occasional downtimes or failures might be tolerable, given the nature of a complementary feedback suggestion system where immediate, continuous operation may not always be critical.

This prioritization strategy aims to establish Athena as a user-centric, maintainable, and cost-effective addition to the Artemis ecosystem, aligning with the community-driven, open-source nature of the project.

== Subsystem Decomposition
// Note: Describe the architecture of your system by decomposing it into subsystems and the services provided by each subsystem. Use UML class diagrams including packages/components for each subsystem.
// - There are 3 main subsystems: Artemis client, Artemis server, Athena
// - Artemis client: UI, communication with Artemis server

As a distinct subsystem, _Athena_ analyzes exercises, student submissions, and historical feedback to generate targeted suggestions. It operates alongside two other primary subsystems: the _Artemis Client_, the user interface for tutors, and the _Artemis server_, which manages its logic and data.
As an alternative interface to the Artemis Client, tutors can also use the _Themis Grading App_ to assess submissions.

The communication between all components in @subsystemDecompositionOverview is facilitated through the respective APIs of the subsystems, using a REST interface with JSON serialization.

#figure(
  image("figures/subsystem-decomposition-overview.svg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Subsystem decomposition diagram: Overview of the interaction between Athena, Artemis and the Themis Grading App],
) <subsystemDecompositionOverview>

=== Athena
The Athena system is written in Python utilizing the FastAPI server framework#footnote[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com, last visited September 6th, 2023].
We introduce the architecture of Athena in @subsystemDecompositionAthena.
//
Placed on the left side of the architecture diagram are various assessment modules. These modules have the primary function of creating feedback suggestions tailored to specific student submissions.
Importantly, these modules are designed to be interchangeable due to their adherence to a unified interface. For example, both the _CoFee Module_ and the _Text LLM Module_ focus on generating feedback for text-based exercises, whereas the _ThemisML Module_ and the _Programming LLM Module_ specialize in formulating suggestions for programming exercises.

Further details on the CoFee module are provided in the subsequent section. The ThemisML module, on the other hand, is an adaptation of the pre-existing ThemisML system#footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Themis-ML, last visited September 5th, 2023], tailored to fit into the Athena framework. The LLM modules -- both Text and Programming -- were by Felix Dietrich~@athenaLLMs.

The _Assessment Module Manager_ serves as the coordinator for all assessment modules. Additionally, it offers an Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate interactions between external LMSs and Athena.

Lastly, the _Playground_ is a web application created using the Next.js framework#footnote[https://nextjs.org, last visited September 6th, 2023] that also communicates with Athena through this API. This platform provides a sandbox environment for researchers, allowing them to test the efficacy of various assessment modules and to preview the generated feedback suggestions for a given submission.

#figure(
  image("figures/subsystem-decomposition-athena.svg", width: 90%),
  caption: [Subsystem decomposition of Athena],
) <subsystemDecompositionAthena>

=== CoFee Module
We largely keep the architecture of the CoFee module as proposed by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2") and Michel~@atheneLoadBalancer. Notably, Michel contributed a _Load Balancer_ that efficiently distributes incoming requests among the CoFee modules for _Segmentation_, _Embedding_, and _Clustering_~@atheneLoadBalancer.
The load balancer is highly coupled with the CoFee modules, which is why we cannot use it in Athena directly. To enhance compatibility, we introduce a _CoFee Adapter_ that provides a unified interface for the CoFee module to the Athena system.

Both the existing CoFee module, called "Athena-CoFee", and the new CoFee Adapter are based on the FastAPI framework.

#figure(
  image("figures/subsystem-decomposition-cofee-module.svg", width: 80%),
  caption: [Subsystem decomposition of the CoFee Module, inspired by similar diagrams in @cofee and @atheneLoadBalancer. The source code of the Athena-CoFee subsystem is available at https://github.com/ls1intum/Athena-CoFee.], 
) <subsystemDecompositionCoFee>

=== Artemis Server

// The Artemis Server is written in Java and uses Spring Boot. In the context of the work presented in this thesis, it is responsible for handling the communication with Athena.

// All the components mentioned in the subsystem decomposition diagram that include "Athena" in their name are enabled using the "athena" Spring profile. This way, they are only loaded if the profile is active. This is useful because the Athena components can be disabled in production if they are not needed.

// The architecture is split into three layers: web, application and persistence.
// The _Text and Programming Exercise and Assessment Resources_ provide endpoints for creating and updating exercises and tutor assessments respectively. They trigger the following Athena services when there are updates:
// - The _Athena Schedule Service_ schedules the _Athena Submission Sending Service_ that sends submissions on the exercise to Athena.
// - The _Text and Programming Submission Services_ that request the currently best submission to assess from the _Athena Submission Selection Service_.
// - The _Athena Feedback Sending Service_ is responsible for sending added feedback to Athena so that Athena can learn from it.
// The _Athena Resource_ provides all endpoints that are purely related to Athena and its interaction with Artemis. It provides feedback suggestions to the client using the _Athena Feedback Suggestions Service_ and it also provides endpoints for Athena to download programming submissions if needed.
// The _Athena Health Indicator_ provides information to the health dashboard that is built-in into Artemis to show the status of the connection to the Athena system.

The Artemis Server, constructed using Java and Spring Boot#footnote[https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot, last visited September 6th, 2023], serves as a pivotal element in the work discussed in this thesis. Its primary role consists of managing communications with Athena, the automatic feedback suggestion system for tutors.

  caption: [Subsystem decomposition of the Artemis Server],
) <subsystemDecompositionArtemisServer>

@subsystemDecompositionArtemisServer provides an overview of the Artemis Server's subsystems.
The system's architecture is organized into three distinct layers: the web layer, the application layer, and the persistence layer. The modules for _Text and Programming Exercise Resources_ and _Text and Programming Assessment Resources_ expose endpoints that facilitate the creation and modification of exercises and tutor assessments. Upon any updates in these areas, several Athena services are invoked:
  
1. The _Athena Schedule Service_ initiates the _Athena Submission Sending Service_, which forwards exercise submissions to Athena.
2. The _Text and Programming Submission Services_ interact with the _Athena Submission Selection Service_ to find the most appropriate submission for the next assessment.
3. The _Athena Feedback Sending Service_ takes on the role of transmitting new feedback to Athena, enabling Athena to refine its learning algorithms.

Moreover, the _Athena Resource_ serves as a hub for all operations that exclusively concern functionality related to Athena. It delivers feedback suggestions to the client through the _Athena Feedback Suggestions Service_ and also offers endpoints to allow Athena to download programming submissions when required through the _Athena Repository Export Service_.

Lastly, the _Athena Health Indicator_ integrates with Artemis's built-in health dashboard, providing data on the status of the connection between the Artemis system and Athena.

A Spring profile labeled "athena" activates components with "Athena" in their identifiers. When activated, this profile loads these Athena-related components. This allows the deactivation of unnecessary Athena-related components in production if needed.

In the persistence layer, the _Text and Programming Submission Repositories_ along with the _Feedback Repository_ retrieve data from the database using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.
Additionally, the _Text Block Repository_ serves a specific function in the representation conversion for feedback on text exercises. While Artemis uses inline references identified by text block IDs for feedback, Athena references the submission text by the start and end indices of the feedback within the submission text. The _Text Block Repository_ helps with this conversion between the two different feedback representations.


=== Artemis Client

// - Artemis Web Client is a web client created with Angular
// - There are two layers: The UI layer (Angular components) and the service layer (mostly connecting to the Artemis API)
// - We add the new components _Text Feedback Suggestion Component_ and _Programming Feedback Suggestion Component_ to the UI layer to display feedback suggestions
// - The feedback suggestion components have to be separate from each other because their layout has to resemble the layout of the corresponding feedback components
// - We change both the _Text Submission Assessment Component_ and the _Programming Submission Assessment Component_ to support displaying feedback suggestions using these components - both referenced inline suggestions and unreferenced suggestions
// - The Text Submission Assessment Component uses the _Text Assessment Service_ to get and save assessments.
// - The Programming Submission Assessment Component uses the _Programming Assessment Service_ to get and save assessments.
// - Both of these components use the _Athena Service_ to get feedback suggestions.
// - The _Programming Submission Assessment Component_ is called `CodeEditorTutorAssessmentContainerComponent` in the source code

The Artemis Web Client, developed using Angular, is divided into two primary layers: the UI layer, consisting of Angular components, and the service layer, primarily responsible for interfacing with the Artemis API.

#figure(
  image("figures/subsystem-decomposition-artemis-client.svg", width: 75%),
  caption: [Subsystem decomposition of the Artemis Client],
) <subsystemDecompositionArtemisClient>

To enhance the user interface, we introduce two new components to the UI layer: the _Text Feedback Suggestion Component_ and the _Programming Feedback Suggestion Component_. These components display feedback suggestions and are deliberately separate to fit into the layout of their corresponding feedback components.

In order to accommodate the display of feedback suggestions, we modify both the _Text Submission Assessment Component_ and the _Programming Submission Assessment Component_#footnote[Name in the existing source code: `CodeEditorTutorAssessmentContainerComponent`]. These modifications enable the components to display both inline-referenced suggestions and unreferenced suggestions. For handling and saving assessments, the _Text Submission Assessment Component_ utilizes the _Text Assessment Service_, while the _Programming Submission Assessment Component_ employs the _Programming Assessment Service_. Both components fetch feedback suggestions from Athena using the _Athena Service_.

== Hardware Software Mapping
// Note: This section describes how the subsystems are mapped onto existing hardware and software components. The description is accompanied by a UML deployment diagram. The existing components are often off-the-shelf components. If the components are distributed on different nodes, the network infrastructure and the protocols are also described.

// - @deploymentDiagram shows an example setup based on the one used at Technical University of Munich
// - We skip the load balancing of Artemis because it is not relevant for the thesis
// - Both the Athena Server and the Artemis Server are deployed within the University Datacenter
// - They each have their own database servers. The Artemis Server uses a MySQL database and the Athena Server uses a Postgres database.
// - A tutor can access the Artemis Server using the Artemis Web Client, which is served by the Artemis Server. It communicates with the Artemis Server using the Artemis API through the https protocol.
// - A researcher can access the Athena Server using the Athena Playground, which is served by the Athena Server. It communicates with the Athena Server using the Athena API through the https protocol.

The deployment diagram presented in @deploymentDiagram illustrates an example architecture closely mirroring the actual system setup at the Technical University of Munich. Specifically, both the Athena Server and the Artemis Server are housed within the University Datacenter.
Artemis can access the services provided by Athena through the Athena API, which is served by the Athena Server over HTTPs.
Both the Athena and Artemis Servers are housed in the University Datacenter and use independent databases: Artemis uses MySQL, while Athena employs Postgres.
We have intentionally omitted the load-balancing aspect of the Artemis system as it is not relevant to the research focus of this thesis.

#figure(

) <deploymentDiagram>

Tutors access the Artemis Server via the Artemis Web Client, while researchers use the Athena Playground for the Athena Server. Both interfaces communicate with their respective servers through APIs using the HTTPs.

== Persistent Data Management
// Note: Optional section that describes how data is saved over the lifetime of the system and which data. Usually this is either done by saving data in structured files or in databases. If this is applicable for the thesis, describe the approach for persisting data here and show a UML class diagram how the entity objects are mapped to persistent storage. It contains a rationale of the selected storage scheme, file system or database, a description of the selected database and database administration issues.
// TODO: Add some introductory text

=== Artemis
// - Reason for MySQL/Postgres as the database: The existing Artemis system already uses it.
// - We add a new boolean exercise.feedback_suggestions_enabled column Artemis to enable the feedback suggestions for an exercise.
// - Everything else is the same: Students submit submissions, all of one students submissions are a participation, a participation belongs to an exercise and has a result, a result gets feedback from a tutor.
// Because we don't want to change the database structure (it's very costly in this case in terms of time and complexity), we use a prefix of `FeedbackSuggestion:` for the text of feedback suggestions that are generated by Athena. When a tutor accepts a feedback suggestion, the prefix is changed to `FeedbackSuggestion:accepted:`. When a tutor modifies a feedback suggestion, it is changed to `FeedbackSuggestion:adapted:`. This way, we can track the state of the feedback suggestion and also distinguish between feedback suggestions and manual feedback. This approach follows the approaches of work on Artemis in the past, e.g. the static code analysis capabilities of Artemis~@artemisStaticCodeAnalysis.
In managing persistent data for Athena within Artemis, we chose to support both MySQL and PostgreSQL because Artemis already supports these databases. We show the relevant parts from the Artemis data model in @classDiagramArtemis.

We introduce a new column, `exercise.feedback_suggestions_enabled`. This boolean flag is used to indicate whether Athena's feedback suggestions are enabled for a particular exercise.
The data structure remains largely the same as in Artemis. Students submit their work as _submissions_, which are part of a _participation_. Each participation is linked to an exercise and has a _result_, which has _feedback_ from a tutor.

#figure(
  image("figures/db-class-diagram-artemis.svg", width: 70%),
  caption: [Part of the data model for the Artemis system taken from the Artemis documentation#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/dev/system-design/#deployment, last visited September 6th, 2023], with the added `feedbackSuggestionsEnabled` column on the `Exercise` table],
) <classDiagramArtemis>

To minimize changes to the existing `feedback` table in the database, which would be both time-consuming and complex, we've adopted a text prefixing strategy for Athena's feedback suggestions.
The value in the `text` column of each suggestion generated by Athena starts with a `FeedbackSuggestion:` prefix. If a tutor accepts the suggestion, Artemis changes the prefix to `FeedbackSuggestion:accepted:`. Similarly, if the tutor modifies the suggestion, the prefix changes to `FeedbackSuggestion:adapted:`.
This allows us to easily track the status of each feedback suggestion while also distinguishing them from manually entered feedback.
The described strategy aligns with previous extensions to Artemis, such as its static code analysis capabilities, which also adopted a minimally invasive approach to database modification~@artemisStaticCodeAnalysis.

=== Athena

// - Athena DB: We support every relational database supported by SQLAlchemy. Specifically, we tested the system using SQLite in local development and Postgres on a test server.
// - General Assessment Module data is shown in @classDiagramArtemis: There are six tables: _Exercise_, _Submission_ and _Feedback_, for each text exercises and programming exercises. This is because the data model for text exercises and programming exercises is different and it is simpler to have separate tables for everything. The relation between the tables is the same as in Artemis, with the exception that there is no concept of "participation". A submission is always the latest submitted submission for a student for an exercise. Because we are not constrained to having all feedback in a single table like in Artemis, we can split the `reference` (which is a single string in Artemis) into `indexStart` and `indexEnd` (which are integers) to reference a part of the submission text -- or `filePath`, `lineStart`, and `lineEnd` for programming exercises. Each table has an additional column called `meta` that can be used by the assessment modules to permanently store additional associated data. For example, the CoFee module stores the ID of the submission that the given feedback suggestion is coming from in this column.
// - There are two additional tables for the CoFee module in the database, which we show in @classDiagramAthenaCoFee: _TextBlock_ and _TextCluster_. The _TextBlock_ table stores the text blocks that are used for the clustering. These represent all parts of the text in the submissions, split by the CoFee Segmentation Service. The _TextCluster_ table stores the clusters that are generated by the CoFee Clustering Service. Each cluster stores additional information to be able to compute feedback suggestions. Bernius et al. describe the details of the clustering algorithm and feedback suggestion generation in~#cite("cofee", "cofee2").
// - The _Text Block_ and _Text Cluster_ tables described were in the Artemis database before our changes. We migrated them to Athena because they are used by the CoFee module and we wanted to keep the Athena database as self-contained as possible, reducing coupling.

In managing Athena's persistent data, the system embraces versatility by supporting any relational database compatible with SQLAlchemy.
SQLite served as the choice for local development, while we used Postgres on the main test server.

The class diagram labeled @classDiagramArtemis illustrates Athena's general assessment module data structure, which includes six main tables. There are separate tables for _Exercise_, _Submission_, and _Feedback_ tailored to both text and programming exercises. 
Unlike Artemis, Athena discards the concept of "participation." Instead, in Athena, _Submission_ table specifically includes students' most recently submitted work for an exercise.

In the case of text exercises, Athena uses integer fields, named `indexStart` and `indexEnd`, to pinpoint the relevant text segments in a submission. For programming exercises, Athena specifies the `filePath`, `lineStart`, and `lineEnd` to give targeted feedback. This behavior differs from the single _Feedback_ table used in Artemis to enable better type safety and to simplify the data structure.

Every table also features an extra column called `meta`, into which assessment modules can put individually needed additional information. For example, the CoFee module uses this column to store the submission ID that corresponds to a particular feedback suggestion.

#figure(
  image("figures/db-class-diagram-athena.svg", width: 100%),
  caption: [Class diagram of the main part of the Athena database],
) <classDiagramAthena>

Turning to the CoFee module, two additional tables, _TextBlock_ and _TextCluster_, are part of Athena's data structure. The class diagram @classDiagramAthenaCoFee depicts these tables.
The TextBlock table contains text segments that the CoFee Segmentation Service extracts from student submissions.
The TextCluster table holds clusters of this text, containing added information crucial for generating feedback suggestions.
The algorithms and techniques behind this feature find their basis in the research conducted by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2").

Initially, Artemis hosted the TextBlock and TextCluster tables. However, to make Athena more self-reliant and easier to manage, we moved these tables to Athena's own database.
This approach reduces the interdependence between Athena and Artemis, simplifying future updates and scalability efforts.

== Access Control
// Note: Optional section describing the access control and security issues based on the nonfunctional requirements in the requirements analysis. It also describes the implementation of the access matrix based on capabilities or access control lists, the selection of authentication mechanisms and the use of encryption algorithms.
As Athena integrates into Artemis, ensuring robust and secure communication stands paramount. This section sheds light on the architecture and rationale of the implemented access control mechanisms.

=== Athena

*Communication Security Between Artemis and Athena*
// - All communication between Artemis and Athena goes through https (except in local development).
// - There is a secret string shared between Artemis and Athena that is used to authenticate requests.
// - This is how it was with the CoFee system before as well, and it worked well and was simple, so we kept it.
// Athena checks that the secret is correct on every request. If it is not, the request is rejected.
All communication between Artemis and Athena happens over HTTPS for secure transit, except in local development scenarios. Drawing from prior experiences with the CoFee system, we adopted a straightforward authentication method: a shared secret string between Artemis and Athena. For every incoming request, Athena validates the correctness of this secret. Any mismatch in the secret results in a rejection of the request.

*Playground Secret Management*
// - The Athena secret can be entered on the Playground web interface
// - The Playground will authenticate against Athena using this secret, just like an LMS
The Playground interface allows users to input the Athena secret. Similar to an LMS, the Playground uses this secret to authenticate itself with Athena.

*Internal Communication Within Athena*
// - Each of the assessment modules has its own secret that is used to authenticate requests from the Assessment Module Manager
// - These secrets are separate from the Artemis-Athena secret because they are only used internally in Athena. This promoted the principle of least privilege.
// We opt for a simple secret that is not encrypted (other than https in transit) because it is easy to implement (no need for asynchronous encryption infrastructure and more complicated code) and it is sufficient for our use case.
// An alternative we considered was to have the assessment modules register themselves with the Assessment Module Manager and then agree upon a shared secret. We decided against this because we did not see the need for this more complex infrastructure and because this way, server startup order matters. This would complicate the deployment. We also rejected the idea of a central key distribution server, because this would have similar problems.
Distinct from the Artemis-Athena secret string, each assessment module within Athena has its dedicated secret. This secret authenticates requests from the Assessment Module Manager. Adopting this separation emphasizes the principle of least privilege, ensuring modules only access what they strictly need.

We considered alternatives, such as having assessment modules register themselves and negotiate a shared secret or establishing a central key distribution server. However, we dismissed these options. Both approaches would introduce complexities with server startup order, and make the deployment of Athena more challenging.

*Environment Configuration Via Variables*
// We decided to use environment variables to configure the assessment modules and the assessment module manager for the following reasons:
// - Very standard
// - very simple & well-understood
// - automatically loaded by docker-compose when running docker-compose up
// - can also be easily set up with a more powerful tool like Kubernetes
// Why use multiple .env files, one per module (and one for the Assessment Module Manager)?
// â This way, it's easy to provide just the secrets each module needs to each individual module. For example, the module_cofee can't read the OpenAI keys, which is good for security.
We use environment variables to configure both the assessment modules and the assessment module manager for several reasons: they're standard, simple, and well-understood; and they integrate seamlessly with docker-compose.
Systems like Kubernetes can also easily adopt this setup in the future. We employed multiple '.env' filesâone for each moduleâto enhance security. This strategy ensures that, for instance, the `text_cofee` module cannot access the OpenAI keys of the `text_llm` module. This, again, aligns with the principle of least privilege.

*Playground Hosting Guidelines*
// - The playground is not meant to be used in production
// - It is meant to be used by researchers to test their assessment modules
// - It should not be deployed onto a production. We did not put special consideration into securing the playground. To enable sending requests to Athena servers that potentially are on different domain origins, the Playground server can proxy such requests. If there should ever be a UI to Athena (which there currently is not), there might be a need to implement CORS protection.
We strongly advise against hosting the Playground on a production server. We designed it specifically for researchers to test their assessment modules, and we did not design its security for production deployments. While the Playground can forward requests to Athena servers across different domain origins, if Athena ever requires a user interface, implementing CORS protection might become necessary.

=== Artemis

*Feedback Suggestion Access Control in Artemis*
// - We follow the standard procedures in Artemis to only allow users with at least tutor-level access to the exercise in question access to the feedback suggestions. More about this can be found in the Artemis documentation: https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/dev/guidelines/server/#rest-endpoint-best-practices-for-authorization
Following Artemis's established protocols, only users with at least tutor-level access to the related exercise can view these feedback suggestions. For a deeper understanding of these protocols, a reference is available in the official Artemis documentation#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/dev/guidelines/server/#rest-endpoint-best-practices-for-authorization (last visited September 9th, 2023)].

*Repository Endpoints and Access Control*
// Access control for repository endpoints
// - Artemis provides new endpoints to download programming submissions from Athena. Only Athena itself can authenticate against these endpoints. This is done using the same secret that is used for all other communication between Artemis and Athena.
// To avoid duplicating configurations, this secret is only in the Assessment Module Manager config and is passed to programming modules if necessary.
We introduce new endpoints in Artemis to download programming submissions from Athena. Importantly, only Athena can authenticate with these endpoints, using the shared secret.
To maintain streamlined configurations, we store this secret within the Assessment Module Manager config and relay it to programming modules when essential.

== Global Software Control
// Note: Optional section describing the control flow of the system, in particular, whether a monolithic, event-driven control flow or concurrent processes have been selected, how requests are initiated and specific synchronization issues
// - We decided to keep Athena independent from Artemis and adopt a microservice architecture.
// - All activity in Athena is initiated by events in Artemis / the LMS in general:
//   * Submission processing is initiated at the due date of an exercise
//   * Submission selection is initiated when a tutor requests a new submission to assess
//   * Feedback sending is initiated when a tutor adds feedback to a submission and submits the assessment
//   * Feedback suggestion generation is initiated after a tutor requests a submission
// - There could be synchronization issues for example if the submission selection takes too long and another tutor starts the assessment in the meantime, getting the response from Athena faster and therefore two tutors would assess the same submission. We prevented that by introducing an additional check in the Artemis server that checks if the submission is already being assessed by another tutor. If that is the case, the tutor gets a new random submission to assess.
The integration of Athena into Artemis demands a robust global software control mechanism to ensure a smooth operation between the two systems.
By choosing to keep Athena independent, we ensure that changes or updates to Athena don't inadvertently impact Artemis's core functions.

We adopt an event-driven design where events in Artemis trigger activities in Athena.
For instance, when an exercise's due date arrives, Athena's submission processing is initiated, ensuring timely feedback.

Synchronization conflicts present a notable challenge, especially with the potential of two tutors attempting to review the same submission simultaneously. In this case, the submission selection in Athena might suggest the same submission to both tutors, resulting in a conflict.
To counteract this, we have implemented an extra verification step in the Artemis server. This verification confirms that no other tutor is currently assessing the chosen submission. Should the verification detect an overlap, the system promptly assigns a different, random submission to the tutor.

// Because the Artemis server runs on multiple clusters, we have to ensure that the submission sending and feedback sending services are only running on one instance of the cluster to avoid sending the data twice. We adopted the existing approach chosen by Bernius et al.~@cofee2:
// - We only schedule submission sending on the instance in the cluster where the `scheduling` profile is active. This is always the case for exactly one instance in the cluster, according to the documentation#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/dev/setup/#scheduling, last visited September 9th, 2023].
// - We perform the feedback sending directly on the instance in the cluster where the tutor submits their assessment. We do this asynchronously to avoid blocking the request. This means that if the server instance crashes before the feedback sending is complete, the feedback will not be sent. This is acceptable because the feedback only improves the suggestions made by Athena and is not required for the system to work.

Within Artemis, we designate the task of submission sending exclusively to the cluster instance where the `scheduling` profile is activated. This approach is kept from the integration of the Athena-CoFee system by Bernius et al~@cofee2.
The Artemis documentation mentions that this activation is consistently limited to a singular instance in the cluster#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/dev/setup/#scheduling, last visited September 9th, 2023].

We send the feedback to Athena directly from the cluster instance where the tutor finalizes their assessment. This procedure operates asynchronously, ensuring no undue delay in the request processing. While there exists a possibility that a server instance might crash before the feedback is fully sent, this is an acceptable risk. The feedback is not essential for the system to function and only improves Athena's suggestions.

== Boundry Conditions
// Note: Optional section describing the use cases how to start up the separate components of the system, how to shut them down, and what to do if a component or the system fails.
Athena runs separately from the LMS that it is used with.
//
Both the Assessment Module Manager and all assessment modules are available as a Docker image on Docker Hub#footnote[https://hub.docker.com/u/ls1tum, last visited September 9th, 2023]. The Assessment Module Manager has to be configured to use the correct URLs of the assessment modules. 
The Assessment Module Manager is the entry point to Athena. It provides an endpoint at `/health` that can be used to check if the modules are successfully connected and running.

If the Assessment Module Manager or a module is not running, the logs of the respective Docker container contain all available information about potential errors. A failure of one of the modules does not affect the other modules or the Assessment Module Manager.

In this chapter, we explain how our system design from @systemDesign fits into the Artemis learning platform and the Athena feedback suggestion provider within the solution domain.

// TODO: Make sure to use lots of UML diagrams

== Artemis Client: Feedback Suggestions
// Feedback Suggestions UI in Artemis
// - For text exercises, we kept the existing UI as-is, but changed the "Automatic" badge showing a robot icon to a "Suggestion" badge showing a lightbulb icon. This way, the UI is clearer and consistent with the programming exercise UI.
// - For programming exercises, we strictly followed the UI mockups shown in @userInterface. 
// - To make it more clear that the feedback suggestions on programming exercises are not included in the final assessment if they are not explicitly accepted, we use the text "Suggestion (not applied)" instead of just "Suggestion" for the badge.
// - We also included tooltips for all badges to explain what they mean. (-> screenshot)

// Feedback Suggestions UI
For text exercises in Artemis, we made minor adjustments. We replaced the previous "Automatic" badge with a "Suggestion" badge featuring a lightbulb icon. This keeps the UI consistent with the programming exercise UI. // TODO: screenshot

In the context of programming exercises, the design closely follows the UI mockups from @userInterface.
To assist tutors, we added tooltips explaining each badge. // TODO: screenshot

/* TODO: Do we even want to have this section? vvvv
// TextBlock Conflict Resolution Algorithm
// - A list of TextBlocks in Artemis is a partition of a text submission in Artemis. The concept of TextBlocks does not fundamentally exist in the context of Athena and there is no contract for assessment modules to only provide non-overlapping feedback suggestions. However, because TextBlocks cannot overlap in Artemis, we need to resolve conflicts when adding new TextBlocks for a range of text given by a feedback suggestion. The corresponding algorithm runs on the client after the feedback suggestions are received from Athena.
// - It adds the feedback suggestions one after another, following the rules shown in @textBlockConflictResolutionAlgorithm.
// - Our main objective with this algorithm was to never destroy TextBlocks with potentially existing manual feedback.
Text submissions in Artemis are partitioned into `TextBlocks`. Given that Athena might suggest feedback overlapping with these segments, we devised an algorithm to handle such situations.
It creates new text blocks from the feedback suggestions and adds them one after another, following the rules shown in @textBlockConflictResolutionAlgorithm and giving precedence to preserving manual feedback.

The behavior in situations 2 and 4 also applies to the horizontally mirrored situation.],
) <textBlockConflictResolutionAlgorithm>
*/

// Fetching Feedback Suggestions
// - Previously, text feedback suggestions were generated by Artemis before allowing the tutor to start a new assessment: The suggestions were included in the initial response for starting the assessment.
// - We changed this behavior to fetch the feedback suggestions from Athena after the tutor starts the assessment. This is because of performance and reliability concerns (see #nfrlink("nfrImmediateGrading") and #nfrlink("nfrLMSIndependence"))
We have moved away from Artemis preemptively generating feedback suggestions. Now, only when a tutor begins an assessment, the system fetches these suggestions from Athena. This modification aims to enhance both system performance and reliability, with detailed discussions on these issues found in #nfrlink(<nfrImmediateGrading>) and #nfrlink(<nfrLMSIndependence>).

== Communication between Artemis and Athena
=== JSON Schema for Data Transmission
// - The previous system Athena-CoFee used ProtoBuf#footnote[https://protobuf.dev/, last visited September 9th, 2023] as the data transmission format. This slightly increased the performance because ProtoBuf is more compact than JSON.
// - We decided to use JSON instead, for the following reasons:
//   * Simplified build steps and maintenance: We don't have to compile the ProtoBuf files into Python code and we don't have to maintain the ProtoBuf files. When first setting up Athena-CoFee by Bernius et al.~@cofee2, we had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to compile the ProtoBuf files into Python code and how to integrate it into the build process. This way, we can simply use the built-in JSON support of Python and the automatic serialization features of Spring Boot in Artemis. Also, we removed Protobuf as a server dependency from Artemis, which previously had to be continuously updated.
//   * We decided that the slight performance improvement of using Protobuf is not worth the additional complexity. This is consistent with our prioritization of the NFRs in @designGoals.
//   * All existing APIs in Artemis, which we want to integrate Athena into, use JSON. We want to keep the communication between Artemis and Athena consistent with the communication between Artemis and the web client. Although we want to keep Athena independent from Artemis, integrating into Artemis is the first step.
While the previous system, Athena-CoFee~@cofee2, employed ProtoBuf as its data transmission format for improved performance, we decided to switch to JSON for several reasons.

Firstly, using JSON simplifies build steps and maintenance. Unlike ProtoBuf, which requires compilation into Python code, JSON enjoys native support from Python as well as automatic serialization features from Spring Boot in Artemis. This approach eliminates the need to constantly update ProtoBuf as a server dependency within Artemis, a challenge we encountered during the initial setup of Athena-CoFee by Bernius et al.~@cofee2.
Our decision aligns with the prioritization of NFRs in @designGoals.

Additionally, existing APIs in Artemis already utilize JSON. This uniformity in communication protocols facilitates the smooth integration of Athena into Artemis, aligning with our aim for Athena to operate independently in the long term.

=== Athena Repository Export Service in Artemis
// Why does Artemis not directly send programming submissions to Athena and Athena has to download them?
// - Too large payload with lots of ZIP files of repositories
// - Transmission format would be a bit unclear: ZIP content does not fit into JSON; providing files directly inline in JSON does not feel right either (too much and too coupled)
// - Athena can access the repositories as needed and cache them easily
// - More general: Other LMSses probably already have a way to access a repository as well and can provide the URL instead of having to encode it in some way in the request
// Why not use an existing endpoint in Artemis?
// - Authentication needs to be separate because it has to work with the Athena API secret (We don't want a separate admin user or something like that)
// - The Athena Repository Export Service in Artemis should be turned off if Athena is not used, i.e., the `athena` Spring profile is not active
// Performance Considerations
Athena is designed to access repositories from the LMS as needed, offering greater flexibility in data transfers and caching options. This approach makes Athena adaptable for future integration with other LMSs than Artemis, which can provide a URL for data access instead of embedding the data in the request payload.

We intend the usage of Athena to be optional within Artemis. Therefore, we have implemented a separate endpoint for the Athena Repository Export Service in Artemis. This endpoint is only accessible if the `athena` Spring profile is active.

== Playground
=== Structure and Features of the Playground
// - Overview section
//   * URL of Athena instance
//   * Health overview: Online status of Assessment Module Manager and all assessment modules
//   * Input for Athena API secret: Only needed in production. In local development, API secret checking is disabled.
//   * Data source for example data: There are two potential data sources: The built-in example data and exported evaluation data from Artemis. The user can choose between them. This feature was contributed by Dietrich~@athenaLLMs.
//   * Playground mode: There are two modes: "Module Requests" to test assessment modules step by step with pre-defined requests and "Evaluation Mode" to compare assessment module outputs to other assessment module outputs, and to real tutor feedback. The latter feature is discussed in detail by Dietrich~@athenaLLMs.
The Playground in Athena is designed for research and testing purposes. It is shown in @playgroundOverview, in a local development environment with only the Assessment Module Manager and the ThemisML module running.

Within this environment, the first elements users encounter include a URL input for the active Athena instance and a real-time health overview that shows the status of the Assessment Module Manager as well as the connected assessment modules.
For accessing Athena in a production setting, a field for API secret entry is available, but this can be ignored in a local development context.
Researchers also have the option to choose between built-in example data and evaluation data exported from Artemis for their tests, a feature contributed by Dietrich~@athenaLLMs.
Moreover, the Playground offers two operational modes: one for the testing of individual assessment modules, known as "Module Requests," and another for comparative evaluations called "Evaluation Mode," further discussed by Dietrich~@athenaLLMs.

=== Module Requests Mode
// - Module Requests: After choosing an assessment module, the researcher can choose to access different endpoints of the assessment module:
//   * Get Config Schema: The researcher can configure the assessment module with a special config schema. For example, this is used by the LLM assessment modules to specify the LLM model to use~@athenaLLMs.
//   * Send Submissions: The researcher can send submissions to Athena. They can choose an example exercise and send all submissions for that exercise.
//   * Request Submission Selection: The researcher can request a submission selection for a specific exercise. They can choose an example exercise and send the request. The endpoint only works after submissions have been sent for the exercise because the submission selection only operates on submission IDs for performance reasons.
//   * Send Feedback: The researcher can send feedback to Athena. They can choose an example exercise and send all feedback for that exercise, or choose a specific submission within the exercise to only send feedback for that submission.
//   * Request Feedback Suggestions: The researcher can request feedback suggestions for a specific exercise. They can choose an example exercise and a submission to get suggestions for that submission.
Within the "Module Requests" mode, the Playground interface presents a streamlined way to interact with the assessment modules' various functionalities.

The "Get Config Schema" option in the interface provides a straightforward method for accessing the configuration schema of any selected assessment module, which is currently used by the LLM assessment modules to specify the specific LLM model~@athenaLLMs.

The Playground interface streamlines accessing multiple functionalities, including "Send Submissions" for chosen exercises, "Request Submission Selection" available only after submissions have been sent, "Send Feedback" for specific exercises or submissions, and "Request Feedback Suggestions" for automated suggestions on selected exercises and submissions.

We show one such section in the Playground interface in @playgroundModuleRequestsFeedbackSending.
The "Send Feedback" section is special in that it allows the researcher to choose between sending feedback on all submissions for the exercise or only for a specific submission. This way, a researcher can experiment with only providing some initial feedback to the assessment module, and then sending more feedback later.

With the Playground, Athena provides an effective and user-friendly means for researchers and developers to engage in real-time testing and evaluation, aligning with #frlink(<frTestSuggestionGeneration>).

// == API Interface of Athena // skip for now => TODO: add this section or remove it completely
// Why did we choose to have it like that?
// -> Obsidian page "New Athena API"

== Performance Considerations
// - In Artemis, we split the submission sending into batches of 100 submissions each to avoid too large payloads and timeouts
To further optimize performance, we implemented a batching mechanism in Artemis.
This splits the outgoing submissions into smaller batches of 100 each, effectively reducing payload size and minimizing the risk of data transfer timeouts.

// - Improvement: For submission selection, we only send the submission IDs because Athena already has the submissions and less data has to be transferred that way. The submission selection request needs to be fast because it is blocking the tutor from assessing a submission.
The efficiency of the "Submission Selection" process is crucial for Athena, especially to minimize tutor wait times. Rather than transferring complete submissions, the LMS sends only the submission IDs to Athena. This approach speeds up the process by reducing data transfer, making it both server-efficient and user-friendly.

== Athena Package for Assessment Modules
// Why do we have an `athena` Python package? Why is the Assessment Module Manager designed as it is? Why do we use Decorators in assessment modules?
// - We want to make it as easy as possible to write assessment modules for Athena.
// - We also recognized that a lot of the communication logic between the assessment module manager and the assessment modules is the same for all assessment modules. We wanted to avoid code duplication and make it easy to change the communication logic in the future.
// - Therefore, we provided a library called `athena` that takes care of all the boilerplate code and allows the researcher to focus on the actual assessment module logic. It works for assessment modules written in Python (which currently are all existing assessment modules).
// - The `athena` library is maintained within the Athena repository. It is currently not a separate package on PyPI because it is not meant to be used by anyone else than the Athena developers.
// - The `athena` library provides Python decorators to annotate functions that will be called by the assessment module manager. The decorators take care of the communication logic and the researcher only has to implement the actual assessment module logic.
// - It also provides helper functions to store and load data from the Athena database, and to download programming submissions from Artemis.
We created a Python package called `athena` to simplify the development of assessment modules for Athena. We maintain the package within the Athena repository and do not distribute it through platforms like PyPI, since its utility is exclusive to Athena's ecosystem.

The package addresses the need for standardized communication between the Assessment Module Manager and the individual assessment modules. By doing so, it reduces code duplication and allows for easy modifications in future communication logic.

Developers benefit from the package's use of Python decorators#footnote[When decorating a function, Python technically wraps it by passing it to another function, the _decorator_, and replacing it with the return value of the decorator, the _wrapper_.], which annotate functions that will interact with the Assessment Module Manager. These decorators handle the underlying communication logic, enabling developers to focus on the actual assessment module logic.
Additionally, the package offers utility functions to facilitate data storage in Athena's database and to download programming submissions from Artemis.

== Adding a New Assessment Module
// How to add a new assessment module?
// - Creating a new assessment module easily is important for our NFR of extensibility~@nfrNewModuleDevelopment.
// - We provide a module called `module_example` as a template for new assessment modules. It contains all the boilerplate code that is needed to communicate with the Assessment Module Manager, using the `athena` library.
// - We added more detailed and technical instructions on how to add a new assessment module to the Athena documentation#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Athena/module/create, last visited September 9th, 2023].
Ensuring extensibility is an important NFR in Athena (#nfrlink(<nfrNewModuleDevelopment>)), as indicated by our focus on ease of new module development. In line with this, we have created a sample module named `module_example` that serves as a template for developers looking to add new assessment modules.
This example module encapsulates all the necessary boilerplate code to interact seamlessly with the Assessment Module Manager via the `athena` package.

We have elaborated on the specific process in Athena's official documentation#footnote[https://ls1intum.github.io/Athena, last visited September 10th, 2023]. There, developers can find detailed instructions that outline the steps to add a new assessment module effectively.

== CoFee Adapter
// What does it do?
// - We wanted to keep the existing load balancer by Michel~@atheneLoadBalancer as-is in order not to break existing functionality.
// - Athena-CoFee by itself is "only" a segmentation and clustering service for text submissions. The actual feedback suggestion generation as well as the submission selection were previously done directly in Artemis.
// - Because of this, we had to keep the existing Athena-CoFee server running and integrate it into the new Athena system, using the adapter pattern.
The CoFee Adapter is a key part that connects Athena-CoFee's specialized services for text submissions to the broader Athena system. We designed this to keep the existing load balancer and Athena-CoFee functions running smoothly without any interruptions.
The CoFee Adapter operates separately from the Athena-CoFee server, each initiated individually. 

// How does it work?
// - The Athena-CoFee server is started separately from the CoFee Adapter.
// - When the CoFee Adapter receives a request, it forwards it to the Athena-CoFee server to process it.
// - After the submissions are segmented and clustered by the Athena-CoFee server as implemented by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2"), the CoFee Adapter receives a list of TextBlocks and Clusters from it. It stores them in its database. This information was previously stored in the Artemis database.
// - When the CoFee Adapter receives new manual feedback from Artemis, it stores it in its database.
// - When the CoFee Adapter receives a request for selecting the optimal submission to assess next, it retrieves the TextBlocks and Clusters from its database and generates a submission selection from them. It follows the algorithm previously implemented by Ziegltrum~@atheneSubmissionSelection. We re-implemented the selection code from Java (in Artemis) to Python (in Athena). Essentially, it calculates a metric called "information gain" for each submission and returns the submission with the highest information gain. Details can be found in~@atheneSubmissionSelection.
// - When the CoFee Adapter receives a request for feedback suggestions from Artemis, it retrieves the TextBlocks and Clusters from its database and generates feedback suggestions from them. It follows the algorithm previously implemented by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2"). We re-implemented the generation code from Java (in Artemis) to Python (in Athena). Essentially, it takes the TextBlocks in the given submission that are closest to the TextBlocks in the clusters and generates feedback suggestions from them by copying the existing feedback. Details can be found in the CoFee papers~#cite("cofee", "cofee2").
// - We also transferred an additional check in the feedback suggestion generation from Artemis to Athena. In Artemis, the feedback suggestions were only generated if there were at least 10 submissions available in English. According to an old comment in Artemis, non-English submissions are ignored because otherwise the clusters would be corrupted#footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/6861/files#diff-c991a8c31e27a496b18e6f1541d635f623481d598658bbaf9c190898ef09ec85L151, last visited September 9th, 2023]. We wanted to keep the functionality of CoFee exactly as-is and therefore implemented this check in Athena as well.
// - The language detection is (as previously) still performed within Artemis, using the `franc-min` package#footnote[https://www.npmjs.com/package/franc-min, last visited September 9th, 2023].
When the CoFee Adapter gets a request, it forwards it to the Athena-CoFee server for processing based on algorithms developed by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2").
After Athena-CoFee sends back segmented and clustered text submissions, the CoFee Adapter retains the processed data in its own database, a task previously managed by Artemis.

Manual feedback received from Artemis is stored in this database as well, augmenting the data pool. When called upon to select the next optimal submission for assessment, the adapter employs an "information gain" algorithm that is a Python adaptation of the original Java code in Artemis developed by Ziegltrum~@atheneSubmissionSelection.

The CoFee Adapter uses its database to generate feedback suggestions as well. It identifies TextBlocks in a given submission that closely match those in the clusters stored in its database and generates feedback based on this comparison. This process adheres to the same methodology developed by Bernius et al.~#cite("cofee", "cofee2"), which we have re-implemented in Python for Athena.

Moreover, an additional validation step has been transferred from Artemis to Athena: the system verifies the availability of at least 10 English-language submissions before proceeding with the generation of feedback suggestions. This check is intended to prevent the potential corruption of clusters due to non-English submissions and is preserved from the original CoFee system.
Language detection continues to be managed by Artemis using the `franc-min` package.

In summary, the CoFee Adapter successfully integrates Athena and Athena-CoFee while preserving the unique functionalities of both, thereby making the unified system more robust and extensible.

// TODO: Class diagram for CoFee adapter?

== ThemisML Module
// ThemisML is an assessment module that uses machine learning to generate feedback suggestions for programming exercises. The approach and basic prototype were developed in the iPraktikum course at the Technical University of Munich in the winter semester 2022. Currently, only programming exercises in Java are supported. However, ThemisML is architected to be easily extensible to other programming languages.
ThemisML is an assessment module within the Athena ecosystem, initially developed as a prototype during the iPraktikum course at the Technical University of Munich in 2023/2023.
While currently focused on programming exercises in Java, ThemisML is designed to be extensible to additional programming languages.

// How does it work?
// - The Submission Processing is not needed.
// - The Feedback Processing endpoint directly generates new feedback suggestions for all submissions of an exercise.
// - The Feedback Suggestions endpoint finds the stored suggestions, applies an additional filter to the list of suggestions and returns them.
// - The Submission Selection endpoint is currently not supported.
Compared to other modules that need to process submissions first, ThemisML generates new feedback suggestions whenever new manual feedback is added to the database. When queried for feedback suggestions, it consults its database, applies additional filters to pre-existing suggestions, and returns the refined list. Currently, ThemisML does not support the submission selection endpoint.
We will describe the two main endpoints for feedback processing and feedback suggestions in more detail in the following sections.

// Feedback Processing in Detail: ThemisML performs the following steps to generate new feedback suggestions based on incoming manual feedback:
// 1. ThemisML uses an AST parser to parse the source code of the submission into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Concretely, we use the `antlr4` Python package~@antlr4#footnote[https://www.antlr.org, last visited September 9th, 2023] to find the methods in the code that the feedback was given on. If feedback was given within a method, we associate it with the whole method.
// 2. For each such method, ThemisML finds the corresponding method in all other submissions on the exercise (skipping a submission if it does not include that method in a file of the same name).
// 3. Using vectorization, ThemisML uses CodeBERT~@codeBERT to compute the similarity scores between the feedback methods and the methods in other submissions. These scores are on a scale from 0 to 1. After initial evaluations, we added the optimization to automatically give a similarity score of 1 to code comparisons that are identical ignoring whitespace. This allows us to save a lot of processing power with CodeBERT.
// 4. ThemisML creates a suggestion for each method in another submission where the similarity score to a given feedback item is above a certain threshold. The suggestion has the same text as the given feedback and includes additional information about the similarity score and the method it was generated for.
=== Feedback Processing
To generate new feedback suggestions based on incoming manual feedback, ThemisML goes through these steps:
  1. *Parsing*: Using an Abstract Syntax Tree parser, specifically the `antlr4` Python package#footnote[https://www.antlr.org, last visited September 9th, 2023]~@antlr4, ThemisML parses the source code of the submission to identify methods that received feedback. Feedback given within a method is associated with that entire method.
  2. *Method Matching*: ThemisML identifies the same method across all other submissions for the exercise. It skips any submission that lacks the method in a file with the same name.
  3. *Similarity Scoring*: ThemisML utilizes CodeBERT to compute similarity scores between the methods that received feedback and methods in other submissions. The resulting similarity scores range from 0 to 1. We vectorize the input of CodeBERT to improve performance. Another processing optimization we apply is to assign an automatic score of 1 to identical code comparisons, excluding whitespace differences, and to cache code comparison results in memory.
  4. *Suggestion Generation*: For each method in other submissions that has a similarity score above a set threshold when compared to a given feedback item, ThemisML generates a suggestion. This suggestion retains the original feedback text and adds information about the similarity score and the specific method for which it was created.

Based on insights from initial evaluations, we chose the threshold in step 4 to be 95%, meaning that only almost identical methods can result in feedback suggestions.
We decided on a high value to aim for a high precision of the suggestions, accepting that this might lead to a lower number of suggestions.

// Feedback Suggestion Generation in Detail: ThemisML performs the following steps to find feedback suggestions for a submission:
// 1. ThemisML loads the previously generated feedback suggestions from its database.
// 2. ThemisML removes "suspicious" suggestions (explanation follows below)
// 3. ThemisML removes overlapping suggestions, to make sure that in such a case the suggestion that ThemisML is more "sure" about (higher similarity score) is kept.

// "Suspicious" feedback suggestions:
// When evaluating ThemisML, we found the following problems with the suggestions:
//   (1) Sometimes, there was a feedback item on something banal like a getter, which was actually meant for another method.
//     This caused suggestions for almost all the other submissions, which were not helpful.
//     We therefore classify a suggestion as "suspicious" if it affects too many other submissions (> 10%).
//   (2) However, this would also sometimes classify a suggestion as suspicious if it is actually helpful.
//     Therefore, we make a suggestion non-suspicious if there are at least 3 other suggestions for the same method.
//     This makes a mistake like described above unlikely.
//   (3) Suggestions are also suspicious if they include words that hint at other parts of the code, like
//     "again", "consequential error", "previous", "later", "earlier", "above", "below" and German equivalents of these words.
// TODO: describe this (?)

= Evaluation of ThemisML
// Note: If you did an evaluation / case study, describe it here.
In deploying and validating any software system, a rigorous evaluation is crucial. It ensures our proposed solution aligns with our goals and meets expected standards. In Athena's context, we broke down our evaluation of the newly developed ThemisML module into three main segments:

1. *Scalability Evaluation*: Here, we assessed how ThemisML behaves under varying loads, especially in terms of the number of submissions and their complexity.
2. *Code Similarity Evaluation*: In this phase, we focused on the accuracy of ThemisML's code similarity computation using CodeBERT, especially when faced with submissions with nuanced differences.
3. *Real-world Data Evaluation*: We tested ThemisML using real-world data from past courses, assessing its feedback suggestions manually.

== Design 
// Note: Describe the design / methodology of the evaluation and why you did it like that. E.g. what kind of evaluation have you done (e.g. questionnaire, personal interviews, simulation, quantitative analysis of metrics, what kind of participants, what kind of questions, what was the procedure?)
// TODO: Add more detail and why I did it like that!

=== Scalability
The effectiveness of ThemisML is intrinsically tied to its scalability.
We tested the scalability ThemisML on two devices: An Apple MacBook Pro (2021) with an `Apple M1 Pro` chip and 16GB of RAM, and a test server with an `Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697A v4 @ 2.60GHz`, two cores and 1.9GiB of RAM.
ThemisML is optimized to run on an Apple M1 chip and can utilize the GPU for faster processing.
We used the same data for both devices.

We tested in several dimensions:

- *Varying Numbers of Existing Submissions*: We generated different numbers of submissions and provided feedback on them. We recorded both the feedback provision time and the feedback suggestion request time under different server conditions and using various feedback numbers.
- *Different Method Counts in Submissions*: We test ThemisML's performance against submissions with different method counts. By measuring the feedback provision and suggestion request times, we determined the influence of method count on ThemisML's responsiveness.
- *Different Method Lengths*: We used submissions with methods of varying lengths to see if a method's length in a submission influenced our feedback provision and suggestion retrieval times.

=== Code Similarity Quality
While scalability is essential, ThemisML's primary goal is to provide quality feedback. We conducted a series of tests to determine its feedback accuracy:

- *Exact Match Submissions*: As a baseline test, we used identical submissions and expected consistent feedback suggestions across all of them.
- *Whitespace Variations*: We introduced minor modifications, such as changing whitespace, to ensure that trivial differences didn't affect ThemisML's feedback accuracy.
- *Variable Name Changes*: We changed variable names in our submissions to test ThemisML's ability to recognize underlying logic despite these variations.
- *Different Code Structures*: By testing with submissions that had varied structures but shared similar logic, we tested the depth of understanding of ThemisML.
- *Randomized Testing*: We executed multiple runs on the test for Different Code Structures to determine any randomness in feedback suggestions provided by ThemisML.

To test these scenarios, we had to specifically disable a feature in ThemisML that detects feedback that affects too many other submissions. // TODO: Describe more about why

=== Real-world Data
We tested ThemisML in a live environment using actual programming exercises from the Technical University of Munich's database.
For three exercises, we trained ThemisML on one set of submissions and then tested it on a different set. We aimed to determine if the feedback suggestions generated by ThemisML aligned with the manual feedback provided by tutors.

After our initial tests, we made adjustments to ThemisML. This included raising the similarity threshold and introducing a mechanism to avoid overly general feedback. After these changes, we conducted our experiments again to measure the impacts of these modifications.

= Summary
// Note: This chapter includes the status of your thesis, a conclusion and an outlook about future work.
In this section, we offer a condensed recap of the thesis content, focusing on both the objectives we've met and those still in progress.
To wrap up, we highlight our contributions and explore potential directions for future research in the field.

=== Realized Goals
// Note: Summarize the achieved goals by repeating the realized requirements or use cases stating how you realized them.
We successfully implemented Athena, a system that receives submissions and existing feedback on both programming and text exercises from an LMS (specifically, Artemis) (#frlink(<frReceiveSubmissions>), #frlink(<frMoreGeneralSubmissionsAndFeedbackReceive>)), suggests the next submission to assess (#frlink(<frSuggestNextSubmission>)), and then provides feedback suggestions to the LMS on the assessment (#frlink(<frProvideFeedbackSuggestions>)). These suggestions are shown in Artemis (#frlink(<frViewFeedbackSuggestionsUI>)) and can be accepted, modified, or discarded by the tutor (#frlink(<frAcceptFeedbackSuggestions>), #frlink(<frModifyFeedbackSuggestions>), #frlink(<frDiscardFeedbackSuggestions>)). 
We added the general capability to suggest feedback on programming exercises to Athena (#frlink(<frIncludeNewProgrammingAssessmentModule>)) and created a new assessment module called ThemisML utilizing machine learning to generate feedback suggestions for programming exercises (#frlink(<frFeedbackSuggestionsByThemisML>)), learning from past feedback (#frlink(<frLearnFromPastFeedback>)).

Administrators can inspect the health of Athena (#frlink(<frCommunicateModuleHealthStatus>)) and select the assessment module to use (#frlink(<frSelectAssessmentModule>)), with the only limitation in this regard being that there is no UI for the latter yet.

Researchers can test the suggestion generation independently of the LMS (#frlink(<frTestSuggestionGeneration>)) using the Athena Playground.

=== Open Goals
// Note: Summarize the open goals by repeating the open requirements or use cases and explaining why you were not able to achieve them. Important: It might be suspicious, if you do not have open goals. This usually indicates that you did not thoroughly analyze your problems.
Due to the limitations outlined in @requirementsAnalysisOverview, we faced challenges in implementing specific use cases, which we discuss here for clarity and future consideration:

- *Inability to Recover Discarded Suggestions* (#frlink(<frRestoreDiscardedFeedbackSuggestions>)): Tutors do not have the option to restore feedback suggestions that they have previously discarded. Consequently, if a tutor inadvertently dismisses a valuable suggestion, the only recourse is to manually reproduce it.
- *Absence of Usage Metrics for Researchers* (#frlink(<frInspectUsageStatistics>)): The system currently lacks a feature allowing researchers to analyze usage statistics. As a result, researchers are unable to ascertain the number of generated suggestions, nor can they track how many of these suggestions have been accepted, modified, or discarded by tutors.

These unimplemented use cases highlight areas for future development and also have implications for the efficacy and usability of the Athena feedback suggestion system as it integrates into the Artemis learning management system.

We also recognize that Artemis offers various exercise types beyond text and programming. Although Athena doesn't currently support these, we designed it to be easily extendable to include them in future versions.

== Conclusion
// Note: Recap shortly which problem you solved in your thesis and discuss your *contributions* here.
This thesis successfully tackles Athena's initial limitations regarding extensibility and adaptability. We've restructured its architecture to support multiple feedback generation approaches, expanding beyond just the CoFee method for text submissions.
Athena now also supports programming exercises, aligning its capabilities with Artemis and providing a more comprehensive tool for tutors.
These changes facilitate easier adaptation by researchers and improve compatibility with various Learning Management Systems.
Overall, the thesis transforms Athena into a more flexible and effective automated feedback suggestion system.
